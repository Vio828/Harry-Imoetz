## What not to contrubute
### Dependencies
It should be noted that our team does not accept third-party dependency updates/PRs. If you submit a PR trying to update our dependencies we will close it with or without a reference to these contribution guidelines.

### Tools/Automation
Our core team is responsible for the maintenance of the tooling/automation in this project and we ask contributors to not make changes to these when contributing (e.g. .github/*, .eslintrc.json, .licensee.json). Most of those files also have a header at the top to remind folks they are automatically generated. Pull requests that alter these will not be accepted.
